Make the promise article more horizontal, there is a lot of code repetion.
WHat we can do is have the repetitive code come in as a slide and have a little description at the bottom of what changed.

Have an inbuilt level evaluator:each article can set a level for themselves.
Then if the article has multiple levels we will show the article in sync with the user's level.

Create "executable code" have a little playground always available. For mobile, we can have a little button that you can click, it oopens the playground and copy/pastes the code you are currently viewing.

Allow users to lint/transform code according to their preference
(for example see async/await or Promises/ semi colons or not, single/double quotes )
