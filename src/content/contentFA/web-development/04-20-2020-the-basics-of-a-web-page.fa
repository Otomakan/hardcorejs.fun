<p class='prelude'>Web pages can often look like some mysterious complex entities. But the more you dig into web development the more you realize that the basic of a web page are super simple</p>
<p>Then you dig deeper and you realize that everything is super complicate so you decide to stick to your superficial knowledge which is enough to impress everyone around you.</p>
<p>So we are going to stick to easy</p>

<h1> What happens when I enter a website's address</h1>

<p>When you enter the name of your website in your <mark>Browser</mark>(like Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer...), you're asking <mark>The Internet</mark> to contact another computer.</p>
<p>That other computer (aka server) then sends you some files. Think about when you're navigating in your folder to find a specific file. For example, you might store your last vacation pictures under <mark><code>Pictures/Holiday/Summer2020/awesome-selfie.png</code></mark></p>.

<p>The way you would navigate to this image on your computer is similar to how a lot of websites work. <em>hardcorejs.fun</em> works that way. You enter:<em>hardcorejs.fun/javascript</em> and it <em>GETs</em> you the file at that location. This type of website is called a <mark>Static Website</mark> because no matter who you are we will always send you the same file.</p> 

<h2>How do the files turn into a webpage</h2>

It usually all starts with an HTML file which in its ost basic form looks like this:

<pre><code class="xml">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset='utf-8'>
	<meta http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible' content='IE=edge'>
	<title>Page Title</title>
	<meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1'>
	<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' media='screen' href='main.css'>
	<script src='main.js'></script>
</head>
<body>
	
</body>
</html>

</code></pre>
