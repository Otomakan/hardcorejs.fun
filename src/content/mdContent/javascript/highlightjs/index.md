<p class='prelude'>When I built this site, I was a bit frustrated when I started looking into Highlight JS's documentation. So, I think it is a good idea to get some snippets and explanations for the readers who are interested into getting some more jazz into the snippets.</p>
<p>Usually I explain how a technology works then share snippets, here I'll do the opposite because it might get very boring quickly for a lot of us!</p>


<h2>Make it work... now!</h2>

<p>Copy this code into any of your pages and you're good to go!</p>

<h2>How to style With Highlight JS</h2>

<p>AS you can see in the code snippet above, we are creating our custom style. this is the hard way to do it, the easy way is to just import tyles made by more talented people. I recommend <a href="https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/"> checking out demos of all style here.</a> </p>

<p>You can copy paste any file available <a href="https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/tree/master/src/styles">in highlight.js' Github Repository</a>. Otherwise you can pick <a href="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/#css">any link you like delivered by a CDN.</a></p>
