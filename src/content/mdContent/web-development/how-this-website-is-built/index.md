<h1>Philosophy behind the website</h1>

<h1>Tech Stack</h1>

<p>I was just playing around with Gulp and I ended up building a tool I liked to generate website. It worked for me so I decided that I didn't need to look any further. </p>

<p>To be even more honest, the build tool for this website is really not great to say the least. If I wanted to be smart about my blog build management I would probably pick a tool like Hugo, Jenkins, Gatsby and more to create my website. So please don't try this at work folks.</p>
